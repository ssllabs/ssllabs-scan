# SSL Labs API Documentation v1.24.4 #

**Last update:** 22 October 2016

This document explains the SSL Labs Assessment APIs, which can be used to test SSL servers available on the public Internet.

## Protocol Overview ##

The protocol is based on HTTP and JSON. All invocations of the API should use the GET method and specify the parameters in the query string, as documented below. The results will be returned in the response body as a JSON payload. In essence, the client submits an assessment request to the servers. If an acceptable report is already available, it's received straight away. Otherwise, the server will start a new assessment and the client should periodically check to see if the job is complete.

### Terms and Conditions ###

SSL Labs APIs are provided free of charge, subject to our terms and conditions: <https://www.ssllabs.com/about/terms.html>. The spirit of the license is that the APIs are made available so that system operators can test their own infrastructure. Please read the actual terms and conditions, which are more involved and cover things such as integrating with open source projects, and so on. For example, it's important (for reasons of privacy, compliance, etc.) for end users to understand that assessments are carried out by Qualys's servers, not locally.

Commercial use is generally not allowed, except with an explicit permission from Qualys. That said, we're usually happy to support good causes, even uses by commercial organizations that help improve the security of their customers. If you're a CA, CDN, hosting company, domain name registrar, we're happy for you to use our APIs (but you still have to get in touch with us before you begin).

### Protocol Calls ###

This section documents the available protocol calls. The main API entry point is "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v2/". If you want to check the API availability from a browser, invoke "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v2/info". There is also an additional API entry point that can be used to test features that have not yet been deployed to production: "https://api.dev.ssllabs.com/api/v2/". You should expect that this second entry point is not consistently available. Further it offers only reduced assessment limits in comparison with the production version.

#### Check SSL Labs availability ####

This call should be used to check the availability of the SSL Labs servers, retrieve the engine and criteria version, and initialize the maximum number of concurrent assessments. Returns one [Info object](#info) on success.

**API Call:** `info`

Parameters:

* None.

#### Invoke assessment and check progress ####

This call is used to initiate an assessment, or to retrieve the status of an assessment in progress or in the cache. It will return a single [Host object](#host) on success. The Endpoint object embedded in the Host object will provide partial endpoint results. Please note that assessments of individual endpoints can fail even when the overall assessment is successful (e.g., one server might be down). At this time, you can determine the success of an endpoint assessment by checking the statusMessage field; it should contain "Ready".

**API Call:** `analyze`

Parameters:

* **host** - hostname; required.
* **publish** - set to "on" if assessment results should be published on the public results boards; optional, defaults to "off".
* **startNew** - if set to "on" then cached assessment results are ignored and a new assessment is started. However, if there's already an assessment in progress, its status is delivered instead. This parameter should be used only once to initiate a new assessment; further invocations should omit it to avoid causing an assessment loop.
* **fromCache** - always deliver cached assessment reports if available; optional, defaults to "off". This parameter is intended for API consumers that don't want to wait for assessment results. Can't be used at the same time as the startNew parameter.
* **maxAge** - maximum report age, in hours, if retrieving from cache (fromCache parameter set).
* **all** - by default this call results only summaries of individual endpoints. If this parameter is set to "on", full information will be returned. If set to "done", full information will be returned only if the assessment is complete (status is READY or ERROR).
* **ignoreMismatch** - set to "on" to proceed with assessments even when the server certificate doesn't match the assessment hostname. Set to off by default. Please note that this parameter is ignored if a cached report is returned.

Examples:

* `/analyze?host=www.ssllabs.com`
* `/analyze?host=www.ssllabs.com&publish=on`

#### Retrieve detailed endpoint information ####

This call is used to retrieve detailed endpoint information. It will return a single [Endpoint object](#endpoint) on success. The object will contain complete assessment information. This API call does not initiate new assessments, even when a cached report is not found.

**API Call:** `getEndpointData`

Parameters:

* **host** - as above
* **s** - endpoint IP address
* **fromCache** - see above.

Example:

* `/getEndpointData?host=www.ssllabs.com&s=173.203.82.166`

#### Retrieve known status codes ####

This call will return one [StatusCodes instance](#statuscodes).

**API Call:** `getStatusCodes`

Parameters:

* None.

#### Retrieve root certificates ####

This call returns the root certificates used for trust validation.

**API Call:** `getRootCertsRaw`

Parameters:

* None.

### Protocol Usage ###

When you want to obtain fresh test results for a particular host:

1. Invoke `analyze` with the `startNew` parameter to `on`. Set `all` to `done`.
2. The assessment is now in progress. Call `analyze` periodically (without the `startNew` parameter!) until the assessment is finished. You can tell by observing the `Host.status` field for either READY or ERROR values.
3. When there are multiple servers behind one hostname, they will be tested one at a time.
4. During the assessment, interim responses will contain only endpoint status, but not full information.
5. At the end of the assessment, the response will contain all available information; no further API calls will need to be made for that host.

When you're happy to receive cached information (e.g., in a browser add-on):

1. Invoke `analyze` with `fromCache` set to `on` and `all` set to `done`.
2. Set `maxAge` to control the maximum age of the cached report. If you don't set this parameter, your IP address will not be forwarded to the tested server.
3. If the information you requested is available in the cache, it will be returned straight away.
4. Otherwise, a new assessment will be started.
5. You can continue to call `analyze` periodically until the assessment is complete.

### Error Reporting ###

When an API call is incorrectly invoked, it will cause an error response to be sent back. The response will include an array of error messages. For example:

    {"errors":[{"field":"host","message":"qp.mandatory"}]}

The field value references the API parameter name that has an incorrect value. The message value will tell you what the issue is. It is also possible to receive errors without the field parameter set; such messages will usually refer to the request as a whole.

### Error Response Status Codes ###

The following status codes are used:

* 400 - invocation error (e.g., invalid parameters)
* 429 - client request rate too high or too many new assessments too fast
* 500 - internal error
* 503 - the service is not available (e.g., down for maintenance)
* 529 - the service is overloaded

A well-written client should never get a 429 response. If you do get one, it means that you're either submitting new assessments at a rate that is too fast, or that you're not correctly tracking how many concurrent requests you're allowed to have. If you get a 503 or 529 status code, you should sleep for several minutes (e.g., 15 and 30 minutes, respectively) then try again. It's best to randomize the delay, especially if you're writing a client tool -- you don't want everyone to retry exactly at the same time. If you get 500, it means that there's a severe problem with the SSL Labs application itself. A sensible approach would be to mark that one assessment as flawed, but to continue on. However, if you continue to receive 500 responses, it's best to give up.

### Access Rate and Rate Limiting ###

Please note the following:

* Server assessments usually take at least 60 seconds. (They are intentionally slow, to avoid harming servers.) Thus, there is no need to poll for the results very often. In fact, polling too often slows down the service for everyone. It's best to use variable polling: 5 seconds until an assessment gets under way (status changes to IN_PROGRESS), then 10 seconds until it completes.
* Keep down the number of concurrent assessments to a minimum. If you're not in a hurry, test only one hostname at a time.

We may limit your usage of the API, by enforcing a limit on concurrent assessments, and the overall number of assessments performed in a time period. If that happens, we will respond with 429 (Too Many Requests) to API calls that wish to initiate new assessments. Your ability to follow previously initiated assessments, or retrieve assessment results from the cache, will not be impacted. If you receive a 429 response, reduce the number of concurrent assessments and check that you're not submitting new assessments at a rate higher than allowed.

If the server is overloaded (a condition that is not a result of the client's behaviour), the 529 status code will be used instead. This is not a situation we wish to be in. If you encounter it, take a break and come back later.

All successful API calls contain response headers `X-Max-Assessments` and `X-Current-Assessments`. They can be used to calculate how many new
assessments can be submitted. It is recommended that clients update their internal state after each complete response.

### Protocol Evolution ###

The API is versioned. New versions of the API will be introduced whenever incompatible changes need to be made to the protocol. When a new version becomes available, existing applications can continue to use the previous version for as long as it is supported.

To reduce version number inflation, new fields may be added to the results without a change in protocol version number.

## Response Objects ##

The remainder of the document explains the structure of the returned objects. The following conventions are used:

* **field** - a simple field
* **object{}** - an object
* **array[]** - an array

### Host ###

* **host** - assessment host, which can be a hostname or an IP address
* **port** - assessment port (e.g., 443)
* **protocol** - protocol (e.g., HTTP)
* **isPublic** - true if this assessment is publicly available (listed on the SSL Labs assessment boards)
* **status** - assessment status; possible values: DNS, ERROR, IN_PROGRESS, and READY.
* **statusMessage** - status message in English. When status is ERROR, this field will contain an error message.
* **startTime** - assessment starting time, in milliseconds since 1970
* **testTime** - assessment completion time, in milliseconds since 1970
* **engineVersion** - assessment engine version (e.g., "1.0.120")
* **criteriaVersion** - grading criteria version (e.g., "2009")

* **endpoints[]** - list of [Endpoint objects](#endpoint)
* **certHostnames[]** - the list of certificate hostnames collected from the certificates seen during assessment. The hostnames may not be valid. This field is available only if the server certificate doesn't match the requested hostname. In that case, this field saves you some time as you don't have to inspect the certificates yourself to find out what valid hostnames might be.

### Endpoint ###

* **ipAddress** - endpoint IP address, in IPv4 or IPv6 format.
* **serverName** - server name retrieved via reverse DNS

* **gradeTrustIgnored** - grade (as above), if trust issues are ignored
* **hasWarnings** - if this endpoint has warnings that might affect the score (e.g., get A- instead of A).
* **isExceptional** - this flag will be raised when an exceptional configuration is encountered. The SSL Labs test will give such sites an A+.
* **progress** - assessment progress, which is a value from 0 to 100, and -1 if the assessment has not yet started
* **duration** - assessment duration, in milliseconds
* **eta** - estimated time, in seconds, until the completion of the assessment

* **chain{}** - [chain information](#chain)
* **protocols[]** - supported [protocols](#protocol)
