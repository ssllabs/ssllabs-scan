# SSL Labs API v4 Documentation v2.2.x (work in progress)#

**Last update:** 17 October 2023<br>
**Author:** Nauman Shah <nshah@qualys.com>

This document explains the SSL Labs Assessment APIs, which can be used to test SSL servers available on the public Internet.

## Protocol Overview ##

The protocol is based on HTTP and JSON. All API calls should use GET except for register API, which must use POST. Specify the parameters in the query string with HTTP header of the registered email, as explained in the following paragraphs. The response body contains the results in a JSON payload.  For example, the client requests an assessment from the servers. and receives an existing report if. Otherwise, the server will start a new assessment and the client should periodically check to see if the job is complete.

### Terms and Conditions ###

SSL Labs APIs are provided free of charge, subject to our terms and conditions: <https://www.ssllabs.com/about/terms.html>. The spirit of the license is that the APIs are made available so that system operators can test their own infrastructure. Please read the actual terms and conditions, which are more involved and cover things such as integrating with open source projects, and so on. For example, it's important (for reasons of privacy, compliance, etc) for end users to understand that assessments are carried out by Qualys's servers, not locally.

Commercial use is generally not allowed, except with an explicit permission from Qualys. That said, we're usually happy to support good causes, even uses by commercial organizations that help improve the security of their customers. If you're a CA, CDN, hosting company, domain name registrar, we're happy for you to use our APIs (but you still have to get in touch with us before you begin).

### API Calls ###

This section documents the available API calls. The main API entry point is "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v4/". If you want to check the API availability from a browser, invoke "https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v4/info". There is also an additional API entry point that can be used to test features that have not yet been deployed to production: "https://api.dev.ssllabs.com/api/v4/". You should expect that this second entry point is not consistently available. Further it offers only reduced assessment limits in comparison with the production version.

#### Register for Scan API initiation and result fetching ####

SSLLabs has been available directly for all its users directly via UI and API to be consumed freely. It will remain the same with slight change with introduction to this new registration API.
Now you need to register yourself with first name, last name, organization's name and organization's email.

**API Call:** `register`

This call will return [Registration response](#register-).

Parameters:

| Parameter        | Mandatory/Optional | Data Type | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **firstName**    | Mandatory          | String    | Provide first name                                                                                              |
| **lastName**     | Mandatory          | String    | Provide last name                                                                                               |
| **email**        | Mandatory          | String    | Provide organization email<br/>Note: We do not allow the use of email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail |
| **organization** | Mandatory          | String    | Provide name of the organization                                                                                |

Examples:

* `curl --location 'https://<SSLLABS_HOSTNAME>/api/v4/register'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe", "email":"jdoe@someoraganizationemail.com", "organization":"Some Organization"}'`

#### Check SSL Labs availability ####

This API request should be used to check the availability of the SSL Labs servers, retrieve the engine and criteria version, and initialize the maximum number of concurrent assessments. On success, it returns [Info object](#info).

**API Call:** `info`

Parameters:

* None.

#### Invoke assessment and check progress ####

This API request is used to initiate an assessment, or to retrieve the status of an assessment in progress or in the cache. It will return a single [Host object](#host) on success. The Endpoint object embedded in the Host object will provide partial endpoint results. Please note that assessments of individual endpoints can fail even when the overall assessment is successful (e.g., one server might be down). At this time, you can determine the success of an endpoint assessment by checking the statusMessage field; it should contain "Ready".

**API Call:** `analyze`

Parameters:

| Parameter          | Mandatory/Optional | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

* `https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v3/getRootCertsRaw?trustStore=4`
* `https://api.ssllabs.com/api/v3/getRootCertsRaw?trustStore=5`

### Protocol Usage ###

Follow these steps to obtain the latest test results for a specific host:

1. Invoke `analyze` with the `startNew` parameter to `on`. Set `all` to `done`.
2. The assessment is now in progress. Call `analyze` periodically (without the `startNew` parameter!) until the assessment is finished. You can tell by observing the `Host.status` field for either READY or ERROR values.
3. When there are multiple servers behind one hostname, they will be tested one at a time.
4. During the assessment, interim responses will contain only endpoint status, but not full information.
5. At the end of the assessment, the response will contain all available information; no further API calls will need to be made for that host.

When you want to receive cached information in a browser add-on, follow these steps:

1. Invoke `analyze` with `fromCache` set to `on` and `all` set to `done`.
2. Set `maxAge` to control the maximum age of the cached report. If you don't set this parameter, your IP address is not be forwarded to the tested server.
3. If the information you requested is available in the cache, it is returned immediately.
4. Otherwise, a new assessment will start.
5. You can continue to call `analyze` periodically until the assessment is complete.

### Error Reporting ###

When an API call is incorrectly invoked, it will cause an error response to be sent back. The response will include an array of error messages. For example:

    {"errors":[{"field":"host","message":"qp.mandatory"}]}

The field value references the API parameter name that has an incorrect value. The message value will tell you what the issue is. It is also possible to receive errors without the field parameter set; such messages will usually refer to the request as a whole.

### Error Response Status Codes ###

The following status codes are used:

| Code    | Description                                                                                                          | Action                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **400** | Invocation error                                                                                                     | Invalid parameters                                            |
| **441** | unauthorized error. not register please refer [Register API](#register-for-scan-api-initiation-and-result-fetching-) | Invalid parameters                                            |
| **429** | client request rate too high or too many new assessments too fast                                                    | Track how many concurrent requests are allowed                |
| **500** | internal errorr                                                                                                      | Retry the request                                             |
| **503** | the service is not available (e.g., down for maintenance)                                                            | Wait for some time (approximately 15 minutes) before retrying |
| **529** | the service is overloaded                                                                                            | Wait for some time (approximately 15 minutes) before retrying |

A well-written client should never get a 429 response. If you do get one, it means that you're either submitting new assessments at a rate that is too fast, or that you're not correctly tracking how many concurrent requests you're allowed to have. If you get a 503 or 529 status code, you should sleep for several minutes (e.g., 15 and 30 minutes, respectively) then try again. It's best to randomize the delay, especially if you're writing a client tool -- you don't want everyone to retry exactly at the same time. If you get 500, it means that there's a severe problem with the SSL Labs application itself. A sensible approach would be to mark that one assessment as flawed, but to continue on. However, if you continue to receive 500 responses, it's best to give up.

### Access Rate and Rate Limiting ###

Please note the following:

* Server assessments usually take at least 60 seconds. (They are intentionally slow, to avoid harming servers.) Thus, there is no need to poll for the results very often. In fact, polling too often slows down the service for everyone. It's best to use variable polling: 5 seconds until an assessment gets under way (status changes to IN_PROGRESS), then 10 seconds until it completes.
* Keep down the number of concurrent assessments to a minimum. If you're not in a hurry, test only one hostname at a time.

We may limit your usage of the API, by enforcing a limit on concurrent assessments, and the overall number of assessments performed in a time period. If that happens, we will respond with 429 (Too Many Requests) to API calls that wish to initiate new assessments. Your ability to follow previously initiated assessments, or retrieve assessment results from the cache, will not be impacted. If you receive a 429 response, reduce the number of concurrent assessments and check that you're not submitting new assessments at a rate higher than allowed.

If the server is overloaded (a condition that is not a result of the client's behaviour), the 529 status code will be used instead. This is not a situation we wish to be in. If you encounter it, take a break and come back later.

All successful API calls contain response headers `X-Max-Assessments` and `X-Current-Assessments`. They can be used to calculate how many new
assessments can be submitted. It is recommended that clients update their internal state after each complete response.

### Protocol Evolution ###

The API is versioned. New versions of the API will be introduced whenever incompatible changes need to be made to the protocol. When a new version becomes available, existing applications can continue to use the previous version for as long as it is supported.

To reduce version number inflation, new fields may be added to the results without a change in protocol version number.

| **isReference** | `true` if the browser is considered representative of modern browsers, false otherwise. This flag does not correlate to client's capabilities, but is used by SSL Labs to determine if a particular configuration is effective. For example, to track Forward Secrecy support, we mark several representative browsers as "modern" and then test to see if they succeed in negotiating a FS suite. Just as an illustration, modern browsers are currently Chrome, Firefox (not ESR versions), IE/Win7, and Safari. |

### HstsPreload ###

The HstsPreload object contains preload HSTS status of one source for the current hostname. Preload checks are done for the current hostname, not for a domain name. For example, a hostname "www.example.com" tested in SSL Labs would come back as "present" if there is an entry for "example.com" with includeSubDomains enabled or if there is an explicit entry for "www.example.com".
